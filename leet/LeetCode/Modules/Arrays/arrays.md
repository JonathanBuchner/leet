An array is a basic data structure to store a collection of elements sequentially. But elements can be accessed randomly since each element in the array can be identified by an array index.

An array can have one or more dimensions. A one-dimensional array is also called the linear array. 

An array has a fixed capacity and we need to specify the size of the array when we initialize it. Most programming languages offer built-in dynamic array which is still a random access list data structure but with variable size.
