     * Wiggle Subsequence
     * 
     * A wiggle sequence is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with one element and a sequence with two non-equal elements are trivially wiggle sequences.
     * 
     * Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest wiggle subsequence of nums.
